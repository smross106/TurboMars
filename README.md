# TurboMars

A collection of codes for analysing and designing turbomachinery for Martian atmospheric resource extraction.

All created by Sam Ross, as part of my IIB Project/thesis in the Whittle Laboratory at Cambridge.

Use at your own risk. Code changes frequently, usually in compatability-breaking ways.
